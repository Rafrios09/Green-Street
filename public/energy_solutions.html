               Solar panels gather sunlight, which is subsequently turned into direct current (DC) power via inverters. The electricity generated may subsequently be utilized to power household appliances and lights. The surplus electricity can then be sent back to the grid as net metering credits. Some solar systems contain batteries, which may store extra electricity for later use. Homeowners may also utilize a monitoring device to measure their solar energy output and savings. Overall, solar energy systems are a clean and efficient source of energy, decreasing dependency on traditional sources and perhaps lowering long-term energy expenses.

            Geothermal energy is thermal heat energy that radiates from the inner Earth. This thermal heat is then used to generate other forms of useable energy such as electricity, heating, and other various applications for human utilization. One conventional method of geothermal energy is in the form of Geothermal reservoirs. Acting as a deep system of wells, geothermal resources allow heat and trapped high water temperatures to be brought up to the surface level as an energy resource.
